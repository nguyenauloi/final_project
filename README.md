# East Coast v West Coast Airbnb Analysis

# Project Overview
This project aims to explore listing data from Airbnb's [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston) and [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle), provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), to determine the following questions:

 1. What month is the best to travel? 
 2. Is there much variance between neighborhoods? Or coasts?
 3. What factors determine the price of an airbnb?

We will use Boston to represent the east coast and Seattle, the west. The data is far from thorough enough, but we will use it to provide some insight into the questions that we have laid out. To determine the third question we will utilize supervised machine learning to evaluate what the most important factors in pricing are.
