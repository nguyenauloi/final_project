## Project Overview
After completing tasks for the day it's sometimes difficult to decide how to best use one's remainig time before having to go to bed. Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks to create an application that, after asking several questions, will recommend the best activity to engage in to unwind at the end of their day. These recommendations will be for the following: passive [e.g., movies & TV, reading, music] or active [e.g., yoga, playing video games, going for a walk]. As we will be pulling from multiple datasets with user-reviews we will be developing and implementing an item-based collaborative filter with the available data.
